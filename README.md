## Welcome to Yunhyong's demo page for setting up your GitHub!
### The objective of this page is to:
- create a simple project repository
- engage audiences with generative ai
- engage audiences with cultural heritage

For this particular project we will explore 15th century graduals. The gradual is a hymn or chant in the Mass - the liturgical celebration of the Eucharist in the Catholic church.
